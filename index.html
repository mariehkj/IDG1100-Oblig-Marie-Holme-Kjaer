    <h1>IDG1100 OBLIG</h1>
    <h3>1. What components are part of the Von Neuman Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>A processing unit that contains an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers</li>
            <li>A control unit that contains an instruction register and program counter</li>
            <li>Memory that stores data and instructions</li>
            <li>External mass storage</li>
            <li>Input and output mechanisms</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>2. What is user space?</h3>
    <p>
        User space refers to all code that runs outside the operating system's kernel.
        It also refers to the various programs and libraries that the operating system uses to interact with the kernel:
            <ul>
                <li>software that performs input/output</li>
                <li>manipulates file system objects</li>
                <li>application software</li>
                <li>etc.</li>
            </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>3. What is the shell?</h3>
    <p>In computing, a shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services.</p>

    <h3>4. Where is the shell located?</h3>
    <p>The shell is located in the user space.</p>

    <h3>5. What us the main task of the shell?</h3>
    <p>Being a tool for manipulating data and executing several applications under certain conditions.</p>

    <h3>6. What is the octal representation of a file that can be read and written only by its owner?</h3>
    <p>600</p>

    <h3>7. In UNIX systems, what is the common name of the special user that can access and modify every file?</h3>
    <p>In Linux and Unix-like systems, the superuser account is called ‘root’.</p>

    <h3>8. Which file permission classes are available in UNIX systems?</h3>
    <p>User, group, and others.</p>

    <h3>9. As of 2020, which percentage of servers have UNIX-like OS?</h3>
    <p> About 71.8% of serves have UNIX-like OS</p>

    <h3>10. The command ssh will:</h3>
    <p>Log you into a remote machine, transfer files between the two machines, and for executing commands on the remote machine.</p>

    <h3>11. UNIX Command: access your current working directory</h3>
    <p>The “pwd” command</p>

    <h3>12. UNIX Command: rename files (give an example)</h3>
    <p>
        You have to use the “mv” (move) command to rename files. Example, if we are in the same directory:
            <ul id="ul-12">
                <li>mv example1.txt example2.txt</li>
            </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>13. UNIX Command: schedule the execution of programs in the future</h3>
    <p>The ‘at’ command is used to schedule programs to be executed at a particular time.</p>

    <h3>14. UNIX Command: Forcefully shutdown the command with process ID 123</h3>
    <p>To forcefully shutdown the command with process ID 123, you use “kill 123”.</p>

    <h3>15. UNIX Command:access your root user</h3>
    <p>The ‘sudo’ (Super User DO) command grants users the special rights to execute commands at the system root level.</p>

    <h3>16. Crontab scheduled: At minute 30 on Sunday.</h3>
    <p>30 * * * 0 (could also use ‘SUN’ instead of ‘0’) (on some systems Sunday is 7)</p>

    <h3>17. Crontab scheduled: At minute 30 on day-of-month 15.</h3>
    <p>30 * 15 * *</p>

    <h3>18. Crontab scheduled: At 05:30 on every day-of-week from Sunday through Monday in June.</h3>
    <p>30 5 * 6 0-1</p>
    
    <h3>19. Script:printyour name and date</h3>
    <code>
        read -p “Enter your name: ” name</br>
        date=$(date +%F)</br>
        echo “Hello human, your name is $name and the date is $date”        
    </code>

    <h3>20. Script:add two numeric values, print the result</h3>
    <code>
        read -p “Enter first number: “ num1</br>
        read -p “Enter second number: “ num2</br>
        sum=$( ( $num1 + $num2) )</br>
        echo ”Sum is: $sum”
    </code>

    <h3>21. Script:inputs username, prints “USERNAMEstored”</h3>
    <code>
        read -p “Enter your username” username</br>
        echo “${username}stored”
    </code>

    <h3>22. Script:Store the output of the command “hostname” in a variable. Display “This script is running on _.” where “_” is the output of the “hostname” command.</h3>
    <code>echo “The script is running on $HOSTNAME.”</code>

    <h3>23. Script:Store the output of the workingdirectory (from where the script is run) in a variable then print the variable.</h3>
    <code>
        wd=$PWD</br>
        echo “Current working directory: $wd”
    </code>

    <h3>24. Create a step by step tutorial on how to create a cronjob that prints “Task scheduled at”+ DATE. Cronjob is scheduled every 30 minutes on today’s date(only today).</h3>
    <code>
        */30 * 20 11 * /root/script.sh</br></br>

        script.sh:</br>
        date=$(date)</br>
        echo “Task scheduled at $date”</br>
    </code>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                First I created the script. I started by declaring the variable ‘date’ with the value $(date). 
                The date command generates the current date. Then I used the echo command to print the string “Task scheduled at $date”.
            </li>
            <li>
                After that I found the crontab for every 30 minutes on today’s date, which is: */30 * 20 11 *. The /30 makes the cronjob execute every 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lastly I declared the location of the script.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>
        25. Create a script that takes an input (letter or number) that will display the answer of a question. 
        The script should when started list a menu for the user with the different questions that can be chosen 
        and which corresponding letter the user will have to give as input to display the answer of the desired question. 
        One of the possible inputs the user should be able to make is "q" for quitting the script. 
        The menu should also have a defaultcase where all the items is displayed again,or no changes is made if the user gives an invalid input.
